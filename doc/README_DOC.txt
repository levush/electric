README Documentation
---
The html documentation has been put into another repository, as it
is really huge and will not be updated too often.
See:
https://github.com/levush/electric-html-doc.git
---
The compressed tar ball contains the created doxygen documentation 
using dot/graphviz.
To surf the code you dont need graphviz or doxygen.
Just decompress bzcat html.tbz|tar -xvf - and untar it into the location
of this readme file.

cp /location_of_electric-html-doc/html.tbz .
bzcat html.tbz|tar -xvf -
if you want: rm html.tbz

Use the surfthecode.html page as start page
 as browsers want to generate a file list which 
takes long as there are many files in folder html.
