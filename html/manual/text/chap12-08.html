This menu provides a collection of information gathering facilities.
The most useful is <B>Get Info</B> which describes the currently highlighted object.
Other informational commands exist to describe the circuit.
<B>Help...</B> and <B>Tutorial</B> functions are available.
Also, default node and arc creation information can be set.

	This command presents a dialog that shows information and allows modification of the currently highlighted node,
	arc, export, or text.

	<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
	When a single node is highlighted, this command presents the dialog shown here.
	This dialog is modeless and can remain on the screen while other editing is done.
	It always shows information about the currently selected node.
	The dialog can grow to include more information if the "More" button is clicked.
	</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/chap02-01.png" ALT="Figure 2.1"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
	Primitive nodes can have their size altered.
	The "Name" field is simply a documenting message that is displayed on the node.
	If you uncheck the "Easy to Select" button, you will have to use the
	<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-left  Windows:alt-left  Mac:opt-click">special select</A></I>
	button to select it in the future.

	<TABLE><TR><TD VALIGN=TOP>
	When a single arc is highlighted, this command presents the dialog shown here.
	All of the options in the <B>Arc</B> menu may be set here.
	The "Name" field defines a network name for this arc and all others electrically connected to it.
	You can highlight the nodes on either end of the arc with the "See" buttons,
	and get information about them with the "Info" buttons.
	If you uncheck the "Easy to Select" button,
	you will have to use the
	<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-left  Windows:alt-left  Mac:opt-click">special select</A></I>
	button to select it in the future.

		This command allows additional attributes to be placed onto parts of the circuit.
		The five possible locations for attributes are selectable in the upper-left.
		You can place attributes on (1) the current cell, (2) the currently selected node,
		(3) exports on the current cell, (4) ports on the currently selected node,
		and (5) the currently selected arc.
		When you choose the object on which attributes are being set,
		you will see a list of attributes in the lower-left.
		If you have chosen port or export attributes,
		a list of port/export names is shown in the upper-right.
		<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/chap06-18.png" ALT="Figure 6-18"></CENTER>
		To create a new attribute, enter its name and value, and click "Create Attribute".
		To modify an attribute, select it and make the appropriate change.
		The "New Value" button changes the value, and the "Rename Attribute" button changes the ttribute name.
		Other changes include the size (in absolute or relative units),
		what is shown (whether the attribute name and/or value is displayed),
		The offset of the text from the object to which it attaches,
		the grab point of the text (how it attaches to the object),
		and whether it is code that must be interpreted.
		For cell and export attributes, you can check "Instances Inherit"
		to make instances of these cells automatically inherit the attributes upon creation.
		Inheritable attribute values can use "++" or "--" to automatically increment or decrement the inherited value
		(for example, if an inherited attribute has the value "U12++"
		then the instance will inherit the value "U12" and the prototype attribute will be modified to be "U13++").
		The "Delete Attribute" button removes an attribute.
		The "More" button presents a highly-advanced dialog for exploring the internals of the Electric database
		(this dialog is not documented, and the button should not be used unless you know what you are doing).
		The buttons in the upper-right control arraying of attributes from one port/export to others.
		By selecting names and clicking "Add" or "Remove",
		those port/exports are checked or unchecked in the upper-right list
		(the "Add All" and "Remove All" control all names).
		Finally, when a set of ports or exports has been selected,
		you select an attribute and click "Make Array" to replicate that attribute to all that are selected.

<H3>List Networks <A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command lists the named networks in the current cell.
	Networks can be given names by selecting an arc on the network,
	using the <B>Get Info</B> command above, and filling in the "Name" field.
<P>
<H3>List Connections on Network <A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command lists the active components connected to the current network.
	The current network is the collection of nodes and arcs connected to the currently highlighted objects.
	If a node is highlighted that has multiple networks on it,
	the particular port that is highlighted on the node determines the network.
<P>

<A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command lists all exports on the current network,
	at all levels of the circuit hierarchy, above and below the current cell.
	It is useful when checking to see that an export is named uniformly throughout the chip,
	because all export names are shown.
<P>
<H3>List Exports below Network <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">[3-7]</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>

	This command lists the exports on the current network and in all cells below this in the hierarchy.
<P>
<H3>List Geometry on Network <A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command computes the geometry connected to the current network and reports
	the area and perimeter of all connected layers.
	Only geometry at the current and lower levels of hierarchy are considered.
<P>
<H3>List Layer Coverage <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">[3-7]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command computes, for each layer, the percentage of the cell that is covered by that layer.
	This is useful because certain fabrication lines insist on a minimum amount of area for each layer.
<P>
<H3>Rename Network... <A HREF="chap06-09.html#chap06-09">[6-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command presents a list of networks in the current cell and lets you rename them.

	This command allows you to measure the distance between any two points on the display.
	After issuing it, click in the circuit to set the "starting point".
	Then click repeatedly in the circuit to define the "ending point" and see the measured distance.
	To end distance measurement, use this command again.
	The measured distance can be used by the <B>Array...</B> command to specify spacing.
	Note that this command is bound to the "M" key (shift-M).
