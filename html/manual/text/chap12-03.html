Cell cells are collections of circuitry.
Each cell of a cell has a view type (layout, schematic, etc.) and a version number.
Because cell instances may be placed inside of other cells, the cell notion defines hierarchy in Electric.

	This command presents a dialog that shows cells in two different libraries,
	and indicating which ones are newer.
	You can select a cell in either library and copy or move it to the other.
	In addition, if the cell has subcells or associated views that are newer,
	they can also be copied.
	The "Examine Contents" buttons compare the contents cells and displays an indication of whether they are actually different or just out of date.

	You will be prompted for the new name.
	The new cell is placed in the same library as the old one.

<H3>Cell Options... <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">[3-7]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command presents a dialog that allows cell options to be set.
	There are check boxes at the top for controling cell modifications, recognizing cell libraries,
	and recognizing technology editor libraries.
	Buttons on the right can set or clear these bits for all cells.
	New instances can be expanded or unexpanded.
	You can also set each cell's "Characteristic Spacing"
	(used when arraying, see <A HREF="chap06-04.html#chap06-04">Section 6-4</A>).
	<P>
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/chap03-10.png" ALT="Figure 3.10"></CENTER>
	<P>
	The bottom half of the dialog has options that apply to all cells.
	The check box "Check cell dates during creation"
	causes creation and modification information to be used to ensure that the hierarchy has been built in the proper order.
	The check box "Switch technology to match current cell"
	causes the current technology to change whenever the current cell changes so that it is appropriate to that cell.
	The check box "Place Cell-Center in new cells"
	requests that all newly created cells have a Cell-Center node (named "Facet-Center" for historical reasons) placed at the origin
	(see <A HREF="chap03-03.html#chap03-03">Section 3-3</A> for more on Cell centers).
	The check box "Tiny cell instances hashed out"
	causes the contents of cell instances to be a gray hash area when zoomed too far out to be distinguishable.
	You can control the number of lambda per pixel that triggers the hashing-out of cells.
<P>
<H3>Cell Explorer... <A HREF="chap03-07.html#chap03-07">[3-7]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command splits the current window, and shows a hierarchical "explorer" window in the left half.
	A recursively indented list of cells-within-cells is listed, and you can explore your circuit's hierarchy.
	Note that the cell explorer can also be invoked by clicking on the "tree" icon in the lower-left corner of the window.

<H3>Down Hierarchy <A HREF="chap03-05.html#chap03-05">[3-5]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command changes the current edit window so that the cell whose instance is currently highlighted is now the editable cell.
	When an icon is selected, its contents (schematic) is edited.
	If the icon is inside of its own schematic (a documentation feature)
	then going down does edit the icon.
<P>
<H3>Down Hierarchy in Place <A HREF="chap03-05.html#chap03-05">[3-5]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command changes the current edit window so that the cell whose instance is currently highlighted is now the editable cell.
	However, if the instance is transformed (rotated or mirrored), it is edited in that orientation.
<P>
<H3>Up Hierarchy <A HREF="chap03-05.html#chap03-05">[3-5]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command returns editing to the higher level of hierarchy in which the current cell is instantiated.
	It thus travels back up the hierarchy that was descended with the <B>Down Hierarchy</B> command.
	If an export is highlighted, that network is highlighted in the outer cell.
	If there was no <B>Down Hierarchy</B>, and the higher level cell cannot be determined,
	a list of possible cells will be presented.
	Arbitrary depth of hierarchy can be traversed with these two commands by repeating them.
<P>

<H3>Expand Cell Instances <A HREF="chap03-04.html#chap03-04">[3-4]</A></H3>
<P>
	<TABLE><TR><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/chap12-47.png" ALT="Figure 12.47"></CENTER></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP>
	These commands cause the highlighted cell instances to be <I>expanded</I>,
	which means that their contents will be displayed.
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	If their contents is already being displayed, this will cause the contents of any subcells to be displayed,
	repeatedly down the hierarchy.
	Once expanded, these cell instances will always display their contents until the <B>Unexpand Cell Instances</B>
	commands are issued.
	For a temporary view of the contents of an instance, use <B>Look Inside Highlighted</B>.
	Note that the expansion information can also be set in the <B>Get Info</B> dialog of the <B>Info</B> menu.
	<TABLE>
	<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../images/indent.png"></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>One Level Down</B></TD><TD>

	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	If there are expanded subcells, these are closed first and subsequent commands will unexpand up the hierarchy.

<H3>Look Inside Highlighted <A HREF="chap03-04.html#chap03-04">[3-4]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command displays all layout in the currently highlighted area, all the way down the hierarchy.
	This "peek" into the cell instances is temporary and will not be shown again if the window is redrawn in any way.
	To get a permanent view into a cell,
	use the <B>Expand Cell Instances</B> command above or set the "Expand" option in the <B>Get Info</B>
	command of the <B>Info</B> menu.

<P>
<H3>Package into Cell... <A HREF="chap03-08.html#chap03-08">[3-8]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command creates a new cell, possibly in a new cell,
	that contains all of the circuitry in the currently highlighted area.
	You will be prompted for the new cell name.
	The highlighted area is defined as the bounding rectangle of everything that is highlighted.
	Arcs that cross outside of the bounds will not be copied.
	A more precise way of defining a highlighted area is to use the
	<I><A HREF="chap01-08.html#chap01-08" TITLE="UNIX:meta-right  Windows:alt-right  Mac:cmd-opt-click">rectangle select</A></I> button.
<P>
<H3>Extract Cell Instance <A HREF="chap03-08.html#chap03-08">[3-8]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command takes the currently highlighted cell instance and replaces it with its contents.
	This is conceptually the opposite of <B>Package into Cell...</B> as it removes a level of hierarchy.
	If multiple cell instances are highlighted, all of them are extracted.
<P>
<HR><BR>
<P>
<H3>New Version of Current Cell <A HREF="chap03-02.html#chap03-02">[3-2]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command makes a copy of the cell in the current window.
	Version numbers appear in the cell name as a semicolon followed by a number
	(except for the most recent cell which has no version notation).
	For example, after the duplication of cell MyCircuit, there will be the cells MyCircuit and MyCircuit;1.
	The current cell, which has no explicit version number in its name, actually is version 2
	(smaller version numbers are older).
<P>
<H3>Delete Unused Old Versions <A HREF="chap03-02.html#chap03-02">[3-2]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command deletes all cells in the current library that are not the most recent version and are not being used as instances in some other cell.
	It essentially cleans up the library when too many versions have been created.
	As with all commands, this can be undone with the <B>Undo</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu.
<P>
<HR><BR>
<P>
<H3>Read Text Cell... <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">[4-10]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command reads a disk file into the current text window.
	It replaces the existing contents.
<P>
<H3>Write Text Cell... <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">[4-10]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command saves the current text window to disk.
