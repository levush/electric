These commands allow manipulation of the editing window.
Arbitrary zooming and panning may be done.
A grid can be displayed.
The window can be split multiple times to show different cells or even different areas of the same cell.
Colors, layers, and port labels can be manipulated.
Even the menu of components on the left can be altered.
<P>

		This command causes the current editing window to split in half,
		with the currently edited cell appearing in both halves.
		Each half may be split again and again, producing an arbitrary number of nonoverlapping windows.
		When a window is first split,
		the direction of split is determined by the aspect ratio of the contents.
		Once split, however, the direction alternated between horizontal and vertical.
		When the editing window is divided, only one partition is the "current" window,
		as shown with a green outline.
		Be careful about the commands that you issue to be sure that the correct window is affected.
		Generally, the current window switches to whichever one has the cursor.
