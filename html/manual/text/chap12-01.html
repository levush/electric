This menu allows you to manipulate libraries of cells, which are typically read and written at one time.
Besides basic library manipulation, this menu permits the reading and writing of libraries in various formats including CIF
 (Caltech Intermediate Format),
GDS II (Calma's stream format), EDIF (the Electronic Design Interchange Format),
and PostScript (a popular printer interface format).
<P>
<H3>New Library... <A HREF="chap03-09.html#chap03-09">[3-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command creates a new library with no cells.
	It becomes the current library.
	Use the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command from the <B>Cells</B> menu to create circuitry.
<P>
<H3>Open Library... <A HREF="chap03-09.html#chap03-09">[3-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	This command reads a library of cells from disk.
	A dialog helps you select the file.
	Multiple libraries may be in memory at one time.
<P>
<!-- NEED 4in -->
<H3>Import <A HREF="chap03-09.html#chap03-09">[3-9]</A></H3>
<P>
	These commands allows a library to be read in a foreign interchange format.
	The possible file formats are shown in the submenu.
	For CIF, GDS II, and DXF,
	design-rule checking is disabled in order to avoid the inevitable errors that exist in the unconnected geometry.

		This command reads a Caltech Intermediate Format (CIF)
		file from disk and creates a new library to contain the circuitry.
		Note that CIF contains no connectivity information,
		so the new library will have only polygonal information and no topology.
		To determine the CIF layer names that will correspond to those in the current technology,
		use the <B>CIF Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command.
	</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>GDS II</B></TD><TD>
		This command reads a Stream (GDS II) file from disk and creates a new library to contain the circuitry.
		On Windows, you can select multiple GDS files, and they will all be read into the current library.
		Note that GDS contains no connectivity information,
		so the new library will have only polygonal information and no topology.
		To determine the GDS layer numbers that will correspond to those in the current technology,
		use the <B>GDS Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command.

	<TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>DXF</B></TD><TD>
		This command reads an AutoCAD DXF file from disk and creates a new library to contain the layout.
		Note that DXF contains no connectivity information,
		so the new library will have only polygonal information and no topology.
		You must switch to the "Artwork" technology before reading DXF,
		and should use the <B>DXF Options...</B> subcommand of the <B>IO Options</B> command to set layer associations.
	</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>SDF</B></TD><TD>
		This command reads a Standard Delay Format (SDF)
		file from disk and annotates the current library with the test vector information.
		Before this data can be used by the simulator, one of the three sets
		(<B>Typical</B>, <B>Minimum</B>, or <B>Maximum</B>)
		must be selected with the <B>Annotate Delay Data (ALS)</B> subcommand of the <B>Simulate</B>
		command of the <B>Tools</B> menu.

		The <B>Library Options...</B> command allows you to control whether backups are kept when libraries are saved.
		You can choose to backup the last library
		(which renames it so that it has a "~" at the end) or to backup a history of library files
		(which renames the former library file so that it has its creation date as part of its name).
		You can also request that the database be checked for consistency at write time.

		The <B>Copyright Options...</B> command allows you to place personalized copyright information into

		The disk file with the copyright information should not contain any "comment" characters because
		they vary with each generated file format.
		Instead, Electric adds the proper comment characters for each output file format.
