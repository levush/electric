This menu is a collection of submenus that controls the different analysis and synthesis tools in Electric.
For analysis, there are Design-Rule Checkers,
a simulator, many simulation interfaces, and a network consistency checker.
For synthesis, there are routers, PLA generators,
a VHDL compiler, and a silicon compiler place-and-route system.

	This submenu controls the gate-level simulator in Electric.
	Electric comes with a simulator called ALS (Asynchronous Logic Simulator),
	but you can also add an IRSIM engine.
	In addition to controling live simulators, these commands can also be used to manipulate waveforms that
	come from batch simulators such as SPICE and Verilog.
	</TD></TR></TABLE>
	<P>
	<TABLE>
	<TR><TD><IMG SRC="../images/indent.png"></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Simulate...</B></TD><TD>
		This command causes the current cell to be simulated.
		For ALS simulation, the cell is converted to VHDL, the VHDL is compiled into a netlist, and
		the netlist is simulated.
		For IRSIM, a netlist is generated and the simulator is invoked.
		A waveform display is shown for viewing signal values.
	</TD></TR>
	<TR><TD></TD><TD VALIGN=TOP><B>Simulation Options...</B></TD><TD>
		This command presents a dialog for control of simulation parameters.
		The simulation engine can be selected (initially, Electric comes with only the ALS simulator,
		but a built-in IRSIM engine is available from Static Free Software).
		The "Resimulate each change"
		item causes each change that is made to something being simulated to trigger resimulation and display of the results.
		The "Auto advance time"
		item tells the simulator to move the time cursor automatically when a new signal is added to the simulation.
		The "Multistate display"
		check tells the simulator to show signals in the layout or schematics window with texturing and color to indicate strength.
		Without this, a simple on/off indication is drawn in the layout or schematics window.
		The "Show waveform window"
		check tells the simulator to create a separate window with waveform plots when simulation starts.
		The waveform window can be cascaded (a separate overlapping window)
		or tiled (placed in one half of the original circuit's window).
		The radix of bus signals in the waveform window can be selected.
		For ALS, the maximum number of events to simulate can be changed if you want to extend the simulator's range
		(and memory usage).
		For IRSIM, the level of parasitics and the file of parasitic information can be specified.

		This command generates an input deck for the SPICE circuit-level simulator.
		Because SPICE is not an interactive system,

		parametrizing them with the actual SPICE message, and connecting them to the circuitry.
