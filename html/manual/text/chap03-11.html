<H3>Setting a Cell's View</H3>
<P>
Each cell has a <I>view</I>, which provide a description of its contents.
A view consists of a full name and an abbreviation to be used in cell naming.
For example, the "layout" view is abbreviated "lay" and so the layout view of cell "adder" is called "adder{lay}."
When no view name appears, the cell has the "unknown" view.
Possible views are:
<UL>
<LI>"layout" (for IC layout)
<LI>"schematic" (for logic designs)
<LI>"schematic-page-N" (for multipage schematics)
<LI>"icon" (to describe a cell symbolically)
<LI>"simulation-output" (captured waveforms)
<LI>"skeleton" (a minimal view)
<LI>"documentation" (a text-only view)
<LI>"VHDL" or "Verilog" (text-only views for hardware-description languages)
<LI>a number of "netlist" views
(text-only views that list connectivity for various tools such as "netlisp", "als", "quisc", "rsim", and "silos")
<LI>"unknown" (no specified view)
</UL>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
When creating a cell with the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command,
you can specify its view in the "New Cell" subdialog.
After creation,
you can change the current cell's view with the <B>Change Cell's View...</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu.
Note that this is one of the few commands in Electric that is NOT undoable.

<H3>Switching between Views of a Cell</H3>
<P>
When editing one view of a cell,
there are a set of commands in the <B>View</B> menu that will switch to an alternate view of the same cell.
<UL>
<LI>Use <B>Edit Layout View</B> to switch to the layout view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Schematic View</B> to switch to the unnumbered schematic view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Multi-Page Schematic View...</B> to switch to a particular page of a multipage schematic
(this is the only command that can create new pages of a multipage schematic).
<LI>Use <B>Edit Icon View</B> to switch to the Icon view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit VHDL View</B> to switch to the VHDL view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Documentation View</B> to switch to the text-only documentation view.
<LI>Use <B>Edit Skeleton View</B> to switch to the Skeleton view.
</UL>
For all other view types, use <B>Edit Other View...</B> and select the desired view.
Note that these commands are equivalent to the <B>Edit Cell...</B> command of the <B>Cells</B> menu with an appropriate selection.
<P>
When editing cells with text-only views, the window becomes a text editor.
You may then use the <B>Write Text Cell...</B> and <B>Read Text Cell...</B>
commands of the <B>Cells</B> menu to save and restore this text to disk.
See <A HREF="chap04-10.html#chap04-10">Section 4-10</A> for more on text editing.
<P>
The commands to edit another view work only when that cell exists.
To create a new cell of a particular type, use the <B>Make...</B> commands of the <B>View</B> menu.
Thus, <B>Make Multi-Page Schematic View...</B> creates a new page in a multi-page schematic.
<B>Make Documentation View</B> creates a blank documentation cell.
<B>Make Other View...</B> prompts for any view type and creates a cell with that view.
<P>
<H3>Creating and Deleting Views</H3>
<P>
<TABLE><TR><TD>
If the list of possible views is not sufficient to describe a cell,
new views can be created with the <B>New View Type...</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu.
This command requests a name and an abbreviation.
</TD><TD><CENTER><IMG SRC="../images/chap03-07.png" ALT="Figure 3.7"></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Generally, an abbreviation should be the first few letters of the full view name.
This abbreviation will be used when describing cells with that view.
For example, the view "fast-layout" might have the abbreviation "fast".
<P>
The "Textual View" checkbox indicates that this is a text-only view,
like "Documentation", "Netlist", "Verilog", and "VHDL".
<P>
To delete a view, use the <B>Delete View Type...</B> command of the <B>View</B> menu.
You can delete only the views that you have created, not the basic views that exist on startup
(such as "layout", "schematic", etc).
Also, there must be no cells with the view that is being deleted.
