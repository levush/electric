		<U>MOST CAD SYSTEMS</U> use two methods to do circuit design: <I>connectivity</I>
		and <I>geometry</I>.
		<UL>
			<LI>The <B>connectivity</B> approach is used by every Schematic design system:
			you place components and draw connecting wires.
			The components remain connected, even when they move.
			<LI>The <B>geometry</B> approach is used by most Integrated Circuit layout systems:
			rectangles of "paint" are laid down on different layers to form the masks for chip fabrication.
		</UL>
		<P>
			<U>ELECTRIC IS DIFFERENT</U>
		because it uses connectivity for all design, even Integrated Circuit layout. 
		This means that you place components (MOS transistors, contacts, etc.) and draw 
		wires (metal-2, polysilicon, etc.) to connect them. The screen shows the true 
		geometry, but it knows the connectivity too.
		<P>
			The advantages of connectivity-based IC layout are many:
			<UL>
				<LI><B>No node extraction.</B>
				Node extraction is not a separate, error-prone step. Instead, the connectivity 
				is part of the layout description and is instantly available. This speeds up 
				all network-oriented operations, including simulation, LVS, and electrical 
				rules checkers.
				<LI><B>No geometry errors.</B>
				Complex components are no longer composed of unrelated pieces of geometry that 
				can be moved independently. In paint systems, you can accidentally move the 
				gate geometry away from a transistor, thus deleting the transistor. In 
				Electric, the transistor is a single component, and cannot be accidentally 
				destroyed.
				<LI><B>More powerful editing.</B>
				Browsing the circuit is more powerful because the editor can show the entire 
				network whenever part of it is selected. Also, Electric combines the 
				connectivity with a layout constraint system to give the editor powerful 
				manipulation tools. These tools keep the design well-connected, even as the 
				circuit is modified on different levels of hierarchy.
				<LI><B>Tools are smarter</B>
				when they can use connectivity information. For example, the Design Rule 
				checker knows when the layout is connected and uses different spacing rules.
				<LI><B>Simpler design process.</B>
				When doing schematics and layout at the same time,
				the typical design iteration is to get the layout to be design-rule clean
				before comparing it to the schematics (LVS)
				because the extractor cannot run if the design rules are wrong.
				Then, when LVS problems are found, the layout must be fixed and made DRC clean again.
				Since Electric can extract connectivity for LVS without having perfect design rules,
				the first step is to get the layout and schematics to match.
				Then the design rules can be cleaned-up without fear of losing the LVS match.
				<LI><B>Common user interface.</B>
				One CAD system, with a single user interface, can be used to do both IC layout 
				and schematics. Electric tightly integrates the process of drawing separate 
				schematics and has an LVS tool to compare them.
			</UL>
		<P>
<!-- NEED 2in -->
			The disadvantages of connectivity-based IC layout are also known:
			<UL>
				<LI>
					<B>It is different</B>
				from all the rest and requires retraining. This is true, but many have 
				converted and found it worthwhile. Users who are familiar with paint-based IC 
				layout systems typically have a harder time learning Electric than those with 
				no previous IC design experience.
				<LI>
					<B>Requires extra work</B>
				on the user's part to enter the connectivity as well as the geometry. While 
				this may be true in the initial phases of design, it is not true overall. This 
				is because the use of connectivity, early in the design, helps the system to 
				find problems later on. In addition, Electric has many power tools for 
				automatically handling connectivity.
				<LI>
					<B>Design is not WYSIWYG</B>
				(what-you-see-is-what-you-get) because objects that touch on the screen may or 
				may not be truly connected. Electric has many tools to ensure that the 
				connectivity has been properly constructed.

						The way that Electric handles all types of circuit design is by viewing it as a 
						collection of <I>nodes</I> and <I>arcs</I>, woven into a network. The nodes are 
						electrical components such as transistors, contacts, and logic gates. Arcs are 
						simply wires that connect two components. <I>Ports</I> are the connection sites 
						on nodes where the wires connect.

		<P>
			In the above example, the transistor node has three pieces of geometry on 
			different layers: polysilicon, active, and well. This node can be scaled, 
			rotated, and otherwise manipulated without concern for specific layer sizes. 
			This is because rules for drawing the node have been coded in a <I>technology</I>
		, which describes nodes and arcs in terms of specific layers.
		<P>
		Because Electric uses nodes and arcs for design, it is important that they be 
		used to make all of the relevant connections. Although layout may appear to be 
		connected when two components touch, a wire must still be used to indicate the 
		connectivity to Electric. This requires a bit more effort when designing a 
		circuit, but that effort is paid back in the many ways that Electric 
		understands your circuit.
		<P>
			A <I>cell</I> is a collection of these nodes and arcs, forming a circuit 
			description. There can be different <I>views</I> of a cell, such as the 
			schematic, layout, icon, etc. Also, each cell view can have different <I>versions</I>, 
			forming a history of design. Multiple views and versions of a cell are organized into
			<i>Cell groups</i>.
		<P>
		For example, a clock cell may consist of a schematic view and a layout view. 
		The schematic view may have two versions: 1 (older) and 2 (newer). In such a 
		situation, the clock cell contains 3 cells: the layout view called 
		"clock{lay}", the current schematic view called "clock{sch}", and the older 
		schematic view called "clock;1{sch}".
		<P>
			Hierarchy is implemented by placing instances of one cell into another. When 
			this is done, the cell that is placed is considered to be lower in the 
			hierarchy, and the cell where it is placed is higher. Therefore, the notion of 
			going <I>down</I> the hierarchy implies moving into a cell instance, and the 
			notion of going <I>up</I> the hierarchy implies popping out to where the cell 
			is placed. Note that cell instances are actually nodes, just like the 
			primitive transistors and gates. By defining <I>exports</I>
		inside of a cell, these become the connection sites, or ports, on instances of 
		that cell.
		<P>
			A collection of cells forms a <I>library</I>, and is treated on disk as a 
			single file. Because the entire library is handled as a single entity, it can 
			contain a complete hierarchy of cells. Any cell in the library can contain 
			instances of other cells. By declaring <I>exports</I>
		inside of the cell definition, their instances properly interface at higher 
		levels of the hierarchy.
		<P>
			Besides creating meaningful electrical networks, arcs which form wires in 
			Electric can also hold <I>constraints</I>. A constraint helps to control 
			geometric changes, for example, the <I>rigid</I>
		constraint holds two components in a fixed configuration while the rest of the 
		circuit stretches. These constraints propagate through the circuit, even across 
		hierarchical levels of design, so that very complex circuits can be 
		intelligently manipulated.
