Although there are many technology descriptions in Electric,
there are many more in the world.
To accommodate this,
there is the <I>technology editor</I> which allows you to modify existing technologies and create new ones.
<P>
The editor works by converting a technology into a library of cells.
You then edit the cells, using familiar Electric commands, and make changes to the technology.
Finally, the technology editor translates the library back into a technology.
<P>
Libraries which describe a technology are called <I>technology libraries</I>.
They use elements from the Artwork technology to describe their information.
Special commands from the <B>Technology</B> menu aid in the manipulation of these libraries.
<P>
There are four types of cells in a technology library which describe the <I>layers</I>, <I>nodes</I>,
<I>arcs</I>, and <I>miscellaneous-information</I>.
The layer cells all begin with the name "layer-" and each one defines a layer in the technology.
For example, the cell called "layer-Metal" defines the metal layer.
The node and arc cells correspond to the primitives in the technology.
Their names always begin with "node-" and "arc-".
The miscellaneous information cell is always called "factors".
Any other cell in the library is ignored.
