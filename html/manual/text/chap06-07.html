Electric has an undo mechanism that tracks all changes made during a session.
When a command is issued, it and its side effects are stored.
<P>
The <B>Undo</B> command of the <B>Edit</B> menu reverses the last change made
(this includes any changes that may have been made by other tools).
Multiple uses of the <B>Undo</B> command continue to undo further back.
The <B>Redo</B> command redoes changes, up to the most recent change made.
<P>
Electric stores only the last 20 changes, so anything older than that cannot be undone.
<P>
In Electric, almost every command is undoable.
This includes some commands that you would not normally conside undoable,
such as the mouse click which changes highlighting.
Although most commands are undoable, there are some exceptions.
Commands that write disk files are not undoable,
because Electric would not be so presumptuous as to delete a disk file.
Also commands that make vast changes (such as library or technology deletion)
are not undoable.
Finally, pure informational commands (as found in the <B>Info</B> menu)
are not undoable.
